Hello my fellow earthlings,

I'm passionate about Astronomy and discovering new things about our planet and the universe it resides in. I also
enjoy learning languages.  Currently keeping my Spanish skills sharp while learning French and German.  Aside from 
that a marathon of Harry Potter is a great way to relax after a long week.

More about me later.... I have some exciting new things to learn!! :-)
